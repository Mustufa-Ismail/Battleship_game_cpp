**1. Executive Summary**

**Overview**

This project involves developing a two-player Battleship game using C++
and SFML. The game follows a classic turn-based strategy model where
players place ships on a grid and take turns trying to sink each other's
fleet. The aim of this project is to implement the core gameplay while
emphasizing Object-Oriented Programming principles, and to explore
graphical UI development in C++ using SFML.

**Key Findings**

The project has significantly enhanced our understanding of OOP concepts
like encapsulation, abstraction, and modularity. Additionally, working
with SFML has provided insights into GUI programming. The includes a
Main Menu screen ,functioning UI alternating feature between placement
and targeting screens,winner screen .

**2. Introduction**

**Background**

The Battleship game provides a structured framework for applying core
concepts of Object-Oriented Programming. By implementing gameplay logic
with classes like Ship, Player, and Game, we are able to practically
explore OOP paradigms. Moreover, SFML, being an object-oriented graphics
library, naturally aligns with our course objectives and provides
hands-on experience with GUI-based applications.

**Project Objectives**

\- Develop a turn-based two-player Battleship game.  
- Implement features like ship placement, grid rendering, and attack
mechanics.  
- Use SFML for interactive rendering of game elements.  
- Ensure the architecture is extensible for future features such as
sound effects or computer opponents.

**3. Project Description**

**Scope**

The current version of the project includes:  
- A basic GUI using SFML ,Main Menu screen.

\- Screens for ship placement and targeting

-dynamic ship placement, attack logic, and scoring.

-Final Score Screen.  
  
Out of scope: computer opponent, multiplayer networking, and sound
integration.

**Technical Overview**

Technologies Used:  
- Programming Language: C++  
- IDE: Visual Studio Code  
- Graphics Library: SFML 2.6.2  
- Compiler: GCC 13.1.0

**4. Methodology**

**Approach**

We followed a task-based modular approach. The project was divided into
three major components: UI frontend, backend logic, and integration.

**Roles and Responsibilities**

\- Ali Asghar: Responsible for the frontend design using SFML (window,
grid, screen navigation, state management)  
- Mustufa: Connecting the UI with game logic using mouse & keyboard
input and event linking.

\- Hasheem: Applying OOP principles for converting the program from
sequential into object oriented way and making the game two player

**5. Project Implementation**

**Design and Structure**

The game layout includes:  
- Main Menu  
- Ship Placement Screen  
- Targeting Screen

-Winner Screen.

**Functionalities Developed**

\- Switching between placement and targeting screens.  
- Grid rendering using SFML.  
- Modular backend ready for linking.

**Challenges Faced**

We faced compatibility issues while setting up SFML with the latest GCC
versions on our systems.

**6. Results**

**Project Outcomes**

The Code is 100% complete, with screen transitions in place. Correct
placement of ships by both players and attacking the ships by both
players in a smooth way.

**7. Conclusion**

**Summary of Findings**

Through this project, we gained valuable insights into the application
of Object-Oriented Programming in game development. The separation of
concerns across UI, logic, and interaction modules helped us build a
solid architecture.

**Final Remarks**

Despite facing technical roadblocks, the project is shaped up well.
Future plans include adding sound effects and an AI bot for solo play.
