A game that involves two players trying to sink each other’s fleet of ships. Each player arranges a set of ships on a 10x10 grid without the opponent seeing their placement. The ships vary in size and occupy consecutive squares on the grid, either horizontally or vertically.

Players take turns to guess where the opponent’s ships are located. The goal is to sink all of the opponent’s ships by hitting all the squares they occupy. The first player to sink the entire enemy fleet wins.
